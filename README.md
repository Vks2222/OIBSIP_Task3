Building a Basic To-Do Web App


In a nutshell, I crafted a simple yet functional to-do web app by leveraging HTML for structure, CSS for styling, Bootstrap for design enhancement, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The HTML provided the fundamental layout, CSS styled the elements, Bootstrap contributed to responsiveness and aesthetics, while JavaScript added interactive features such as task addition and removal. This project is an ideal starting point for beginners, combining essential web development technologies to create a user-friendly to-do application.
